Author: Eric Kirira Maranga

This will be a research project whose main focus will be to learn how to create a fully functional and responsive project 
management system that will not be using any frameworks or plug-ins whatsoever.
This system will purely be made in HTML, PHP, CSS and JS code
It will mimic a real world framework, using oop php as the main programming language and hacklang

Enjoy :)
